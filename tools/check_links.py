"""Link and content checks for the profile repository.

Scans README.md, llms.txt, SECURITY.md and docs/*.md for Markdown links,
HTML href/src attributes and bare URLs, then checks in order:

1. Every link is https, never http.
2. Every github.com/ryanduguid/<repo> link resolves to that exact repository.
   A rename redirect (301 to a different repo path) is a FAILURE even though
   the request ends in a 200, because redirects break if the old name is reused.
3. Every other absolute link resolves (2xx after redirects).
4. Retired repository names and em or en dashes must not appear outside the
   allowed history notes in docs/MAINTAINING.md.
5. No github.com/ryanduguid/<repo> link may resolve to an archived
   repository. The September 2026 consolidation archived thirteen public
   repositories after their code moved into the monorepos (two more source
   repositories were renamed into the monorepos, which check 2 already
   catches); an archived repository still answers 200, so the redirect check
   cannot see it. Only links that resolved and passed check 2 are classified.
   Each repository is looked up once through the GitHub REST API
   (GITHUB_TOKEN lifts the rate limit) with the same transient-failure
   retries, and a lookup that cannot complete is a failure, not a pass.
   ARCHIVED_TARGET_ALLOWLIST names, per file, the archived repositories that
   file may link on purpose: FORKS.md records archived forks in its own
   tables.

Exit 0 clean, 1 on any failure. Stdlib only.
